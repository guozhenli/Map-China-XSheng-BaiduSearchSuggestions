# Display Baidu Search Suggestions for China's Provinces (Sheng's) on a Map
## What it does
This webpage displays Baidu's search suggestions (aka. auto complete) for each [province]+[user search word] combination. It's an indication of what people frequently search about a topic for each province of China.
## How it works
Once you input something in the text input box, the webpage combines each province's name and your input word, and queries Baidu's search suggestion API for suggested words. These suggestions from Baidu are then displayed at each province's geographic location.
